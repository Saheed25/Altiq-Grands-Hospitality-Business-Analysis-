# Altiq Grands Hospitality Business-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using Power Bi)

# Project Problem Statement
Altiq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality business for 20years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision making in management, Altiq Grands is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Altiq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue, However, they do not have an in-house data-analytics team to provide them with these insights.
Their revenue management team had decided to heir a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from historical data.
