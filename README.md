# Altiq Grands Hospitality Business-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using Power Bi)

Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision making in management, Altiq Grands is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Altiq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue, However, they do not have an in-house data-analytics team to provide them with these insights.
Their revenue management team had decided to heir a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from historical data.

**Project Insight**
- The hospitality business for the 3months has recorded a revenue of 1.69bn
- The luxury categories make the bigger portion (61.62%) of the revenue
- The fluctuation of RevPar and %Occupancy follows the same trend with ADR being constant through the 3month
- High realization% correlates with low cancellation%
- Most Hotels with high realization% have a higher rating
- Hotels with low occupancy% have a low rating
- Weekday and weekend ADR are constant

**Final Conclusion:**
- ADR being constant is an indication of fixed pricing and other pricing methods could be employed to maximize revenue on occupancy
- Rating review should be analyzed to determine what the customers are saying about the hotels with lower rating.
